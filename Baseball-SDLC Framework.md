# Baseball-SDLC Framework

## Introduction
The Baseball-SDLC Framework draws parallels between the collaborative nature of a baseball team and the structured approach of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Both fields require effective communication, strategic planning, and cohesive teamwork to achieve their goals. This document explores the essential elements of meetings, leadership dynamics, and team hierarchy within the context of baseball and how they correspond to the SDLC.
