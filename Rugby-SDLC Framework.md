# Rugby-SDLC Framework

## Description
The Rugby-SDLC framework aims to apply the principles of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to the context of rugby, illustrating how project management concepts can be mirrored in team-based sports. This framework provides a structured approach to understanding how rugby terminology and practices correlate with the stages of the SDLC, thereby enhancing the comprehension of teamwork, strategy, and project completion in both fields.

## Framework Overview
- **Players as Employees**: Each player on the rugby team represents an employee in a project team.
- **Ball as a Task/Project**: The rugby ball symbolizes a task or project that the team is working on.
- **Scoring a Try as Project Completion**: Successfully scoring a try represents the completion of a project.
- **Cyclical Nature**: The framework emphasizes that rugby projects are ongoing and can cycle through phases repeatedly. After scoring a try (completing a project), teams can analyze their performance, gather feedback, and apply insights to improve their strategies in future matches, aiming to score more effectively.

## Key Terms and Their SDLC Equivalents

| Rugby Term            | SDLC Equivalent                | Description                                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Scrum (Rugby)       | Daily Standup                 | A brief meeting for team members to discuss progress and obstacles. |
| Kickoff              | Project Kickoff               | The beginning of a project where roles and goals are defined. |
| Scrum Master (Team Captain) | Key Player                   | The key player responsible for driving the project forward and facilitating communication. |
| Ruck                 | Critical Tasks                | Situations where the team must work together to secure the ball, akin to high-stakes tasks that can determine project success. |
| Lineout              | Project Review Events         | Opportunities to reset and strategize during the project. |
| Penalty Kick         | Opportunity for Reassessment   | High-stakes decisions that can change the course of a project. |

## Goals
- Develop a comprehensive guide for rugby that maps rugby terminology to SDLC stages.
- Create visual representations (diagrams, charts) of the framework.
- Provide examples and case studies from rugby to illustrate the framework in action.

## Tasks
- Research and compile terminology from rugby.
- Map rugby actions to SDLC stages.
- Create documentation and visual aids for rugby.
- Review and refine the framework with input from team members.

## Expected Outcomes
- A detailed Rugby-SDLC framework that can be utilized for training, coaching, and project management in rugby and other team-based activities.
- Enhanced understanding of teamwork, strategy, and project completion in both rugby and software development contexts.

## Next Steps
- Assign team members to research specific rugby concepts.
- Schedule an initial brainstorming session to discuss findings and ideas.
