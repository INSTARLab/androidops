# 🛡️ Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF) Progress Update Template

This template follows the same structure as our daily Agile Progress Updates, tailored specifically for tracking our team's progress across each pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF). It includes the pillar focus, current task, individual ownership, progress status, due dates, and the corresponding project phase from the A.N.D.R.O.I.D. Ops Framework. This ensures clarity, accountability, and alignment across the team as we work toward compliance.
